In every real world problem, the first step to build a solution focused model is to perform an exploratory data analysis. This will estabilish the suitable model for the problem, which can be further used to tune up the performance and solve the problem efficiently.

Exploratory data analysis for artificial neural network deals in playing with the hidden layers and activation functions. Advanced big-data problems, image based problems and many other complex problems arre now tackled with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). 

Deep learning has been extensively used in many complex research problems, because of itâ€™s ability to gain insights from big data, skip the process of data feature extraction in many cases (CNN can work directly on the images, without any feature extraction). CNN in computer vision applications has another benefit of keeping the spatial property of the image intact, which can be very useful for many geometrical based computations and inference.
